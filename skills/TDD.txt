Test Driven Developerment

1. write a failing test

while(i++){
	do(i%3);
	if(perfect())
		break;
}

	Types of Test
1. Unit Test -> focuses on a single method
2. Integration Test -> ensures different parts of a system work correctly together
3. End-to-End Test -> makes sure your application works in real-world situations
